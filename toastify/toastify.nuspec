   <releaseNotes>
    # Toastify 1.8.3 - 10/3/2016
    - BUG: Toastify was no longer minimizing Spotify on startup (when the setting was set) - thanks darrenshare!
	- Exception handling cleanup

	# Toastify 1.8.2 - 8/3/2016
	- Fixed crash when clicking on toast (that should show Spotify)
	
	# Toastify 1.8.0 - 8/3/2016
	- Toastify now loads album art again
	- Toastify no longer causes Spotify to consume copious amounts of system resources (Spotify readded the current playing song to the title).
	- - We lose full control of Spotify, such as thumbs up / down :(
	- Added setting to allow you to keep your computer awake while Spotify is playing music
	- We have started collecting anonymous usage stats - opt out in Settings.
	
    # Toastify 1.7.8 - 26/8/2015
	- Fixed toast stealing focus (thanks to everyone who reported this) 
	- Fixed version constantly bugging to update

	# Toastify 1.7.7 - 12/8/2015
	- Fixed incorrect binaries pushed in 1.7.6 which caused the toasts to disappear on some devices

	# Toastify 1.7.6 - 10/8/2015
	- Support for extracting Artist / Song from the latest version of Spotify (thanks arosner3 and emptythecache!)
	- Fixed empty toast during launch 
	- Fixed fps drop (in at least one case) as per https://toastify.codeplex.com/discussions/641430

	# Toastify 1.7.5 - 23/3/2015
	- Experimental hotkeys for thumbs up and thumbs down (fixes a long standing request, #11693)
	- 13363 - use regular - instead of Unicode dash for "artist - title" to help with some older bits of ASCII only software

	# Toastify 1.7.4 - 22/3/2015
	- Added a setting to minimize Spotify on launch 
	- Feature Request 13516: Save current track to file (useful for scenarios such as piping the current playing track to Open Broadcaster Software etc.)
	- Installer will now terminate any lingering ChromeDriver processes

	# Toastify 1.7.3 - 20/3/2015
	- Remove warning that hotkeys without a modifier are invalid (since they were, in fact, valid). Tracked under issue #13510
	- More robust killing of Spotify (cleanly and eventually forcefully) when exiting Toastify
	- Avoid potential for duplicate hotkey entries in the Settings list

	
	# Toastify 1.7.2
    - Corrected version (bug #13508)
    - Added support for Win key in hotkeys (thanks bwp11!)

    # Toastify 1.7.1
    - Support for Spotify v1
    - This support is much more invasive than previous versions due to changes made by Spotify (primarily the removal of the Artist / Track from the title bar). It has some benefits, but also comes with some down sides (we must restart Spotify when launching Toastify). There will also be bugs.
    - Support for Toast positioning on high-DPI screens, you may need to re-position your Toasts
